# Technical Test - Calls Export API

## Context

Modjoâ€™s mission is to drive revenue teams productivity & performance with AI-extracted knowledge from customers interactions.

As part of doing this, we are collecting audio and video recordings of calls and meetings between Sales Representatives (commerciaux ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) and their prospects, transcribing those calls into text, and summarizing them.

As part of our service, we would like **to offer an API that allows our customers to access their calls metadata, transcripts and summaries.**

## Your mission

You will develop an API that will do this.

The code should be in Typescript, and the API should be operational.

You will decide yourself what data models to use for representing the objects above.

Donâ€™t hesitate to take shortcuts and keep things simple.

Please share with us the code of the project and anything else that you find relevant with it
